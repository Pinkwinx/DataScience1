            In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.

            We wanted to surface the notable labels in hip hop's history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard (collaborating with

            to call out insights). By highlighting the labels who produced the most hits at any given time, we'd understand who was wielding enormous influence on hip hop's sound, distribution, and direction.

            Let's look at just 1989, the launch of Billboard's "Hot Rap Singles" chart:

            In 1989, regional independent labels dominated with superstar signings: Young MC and the Pharcyde are signed to Delicious Vinyl. Biz Markie (Just a Friend), Big Daddy Kane (Smooth Operator), and Marley Marl were all on Cold Chillin'. Ruthless, Eazy E's label, had N.W.A. and The D.O.C. on its roster. Jive is crushing it with a roster that includes Boogie Down Productions, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and Too $hort. And Tommy Boy presciently released both De La Soul and Queen Latifah's first albums.
